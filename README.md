### Game Mechanics ðŸŽ®

Each round, every player gets a chance to do something cool. Youâ€™ve got three main moves, and you can enter them using full words or shortcuts:

- **Attack** (`attack` or `a`): Hit your enemy to deal some damage. Just say who youâ€™re targeting, like `attack 2` or `a 2` to hit player 2.
- **Special** (`special` or `sp`): Show off your characterâ€™s special skills. These moves cost some resources but pack a punch. Example: `special 2` or `sp 2` to aim at player 2.
- **Support** (`support` or `su`): Heal yourself or help a teammate. Say `support 2` or `su 2` to assist player 2, or just use `support`/`su` to heal yourself.

Keep an eye on your health and resources and no going over the max! If you hit zero health, you're out of the game. The team with all its players wiped out loses, so play smart and make your moves count!
